The game offers the player 3 characters by which the player can fight against monsters. Each character has its own damage, health, and money properties. After selecting the character, the game offers the player 5 types of locations to go and play;
- <h4>Safe House</h4>Without any monster & the player is being rehealthed at this location
- <h4>Cave</h4>The player may face with "Zombies"
- <h4>River</h4>The player may face with "Bears"
- <h4>Forest</h4>The player may face with "Vampires"

After the player kills all the monsters on related locations, the player shloud go to Safe House. In Safe House, it is checked if the player has obtained all the awards from all locations. If no, then the game will continue if yes, then the game is finised and the players wins the game :)
